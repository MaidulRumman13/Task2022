## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this feature section and get it looking as close to the design as possible using Html, CSS & Javascript (if needed).

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. 

Your users should:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## Submitting your solution

You can create a public repository in Github and share the link with us.
